Hi Folks, This Is my FullStack Webapplication for Todo app, I used ReactJS for Frontend and Django(Python) for Backend.
Now, I Explain How you can use it in below steps:
step:1 Download the source code
step2: Make a folder, copy all the source code files into that folder
step3: In your command prompt, start virtual environment, Go to Backend folder(In source code), type this command PY MANAGE.PY RUNSERVER
step4: open anothe coomand prompt, now move to frontend folder, type this command NPM RUN BUILD

You can Now access a Web TodoApp

(NOTE: YOU NEED TO PRE-INSTALL THE python and NPM in your machine to run this code)
